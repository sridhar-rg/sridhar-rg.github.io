                      <li><strong>Development of metatranscriptomics assays for the agnostic detection of infectious agents in nasopharyngeal samples</strong></li>
                      Developed the concepts, constructed computational algorithms for CRISPR designs and performed analysis to functionally evaluate NGS assays 
                      for detecting viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens in clinical nasopharyngeal samples
                      <li><strong>Design of CRISPR-powered WGS assay for use in new-born screening panels (NBS) for early detection of genetic diseases</strong></li>
                      Collaborated with clinical labs (Dr. Madhuri Hegde lab at Revvity Omics) to gather requirements, design bioinformatics pipelines, build & test WGS assays and launch 
                      products for NBS panels. The concept involves the use of CRISPRs to selectively eliminate pseudogene derived molecules in WGS libraries to prevent
                      the contamination of variant data on select genes of interest (ABCD1, GBA1, CYP21A2 etc.)
                      <li><strong>Detection of rare isoforms and SNPs in low-abundant genes from clinically derived blood and fibroblast samples</strong></li>
                      Championed the partnership with UCLA Health and Dr. Stan Nelson's lab to develop a RNA-seq assay for clinical samples (blood and fibroblast) that enhances
                      the sequencing depth for thousands of lowly expressed genes. Conventional assays prevent the ability of NGS technologies from providing insights into
                      low-abundant genes and their variants that have implications in genetic diseases. 
                      <li><strong>Design and development of the Cipher instrument for clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases</strong> (ongoing clinical development for EU)</li>
                      Functioned in a dual role as the technical lead and a project manager in developing a clinically approved instrument that performs the sample-to-library workflow
                      in under 8 hours. Implemented CLIA-compliant processes for experimental design, computational modeling, bioinformatics analysis, documentation, and reagent development. 
                      Leveraged CI/CD pipelines to develop robust bioinformatics methods for infectious agent detection. Ensured HIPAA compatibility across software solutions and maintained 
                      documentation in accordance with 23CFR regulatory standards, supporting end-to-end laboratory and data compliance
                      <li><strong>Launched companion products for PacBio and 10x Genomics' single-cell RNA sequencing</strong></li>
                      Led the partnership with <a href="">10x Genomics</a> and 
                      <a href="https://www.jumpcodegenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tech-note-improved-isoform-detection-sensitivity-PacBio-iso-seq-using-single-cell-RNA-boost-012023-v3.pdf">Pacific Biosciences</a> 
                      to provide companion products from Jumpcode Genomics. 
                      10x Genomics' Chromium instrument uses microfluidics and chemistry to capture single cells in tiny droplets that are equipped with enzymes to perform library preparation for RNA-seq. Our team
                      was instrumental in demonstrating that Jumpcode Genomics CRISPRclean technology could complement the workflow by providing customers to reduce sequencing depth and costs by half while generating 
                      datasets of the same quality. 
                      Pacific Biosciences' MAS-Seq and MAS-Iso-Seq workflows utilizes the concatenation of long-range transcriptomics fragments to enable greater discovery and accurate quantification. Our team worked with
                      PacBio's technical and product teams providing them bioinformatics workflows and proof-of-concept datasets that resulted in a successful partnership.

                      <li><strong>Ribodepletion products for use with Revvity, NEBNext, Illumina, Takara, Watchmaker and Qiagen's library preparation workflows</strong></li>
                      More than 80% of the molecules sequenced in a total RNA-seq workflow map to ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Studies for gene expression analysis, immunology and variant discovery does not use rRNA expression datasets
                      to fulfill their research goals. While probe- and enzyme-based methods are commercially available, the efficacy of these methods is low and the cost of sequencing valuable molecules is high. My team designed 
                      a cohort of CRISPR-gRNAs that can deplete rRNA molecules in mammalian cell types with high efficiency, selectivity and precision. I led the intiatives in incorporating this product in commercially available 
                      library preparation workflows. The effort involved thorough study of each library preparation process, design of experiments, and setting up bioinformatics pipelines for the evaluation and comparison of methods 
                      available from Takara (SMART-seq), Qiagen, NEBNext, Illumina, Revvity, Watchmaker and many other partners. To date, this product has been the highest revenue generator for Jumpcode.

                  <h4>Infectious Disease Diagnosis: Zero-day Pandemic Preparedness</h4>
                  <p>
                    Jumpcode Genomics team was awarded a $750k contract from <a href="https://www.sdbj.com/technology/barda-taps-jumpcode-pathogen-detection-program/">BARDA</a> 
                    to develop an automated workflow leveraging our CRISPR depletion technology to detect infectious agents using metatranscriptomics sequencing. In 2023, we 
                    published an <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10110940/">article</a> demonstrating a proof of concept of this methodology. Our team used 
                    CRISPR-RNPs designed to remove highly abundant human-derived RNA (e.g. rRNA, house-keeping genes) in libraries generated from nasal samples of patients tested
                    positive for SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatics analysis I performed indicated that this CRISPR-enhanced metatranscriptomics workflow could lead to an increased sensitivity
                    and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. 
                    <img src="assets/images/sars-cov-2.png" alt="sars-cov-2-depth" class="research-section-image"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jumpcode collaborated with BARDA and their partners to further advance this technology by removing human-derived mRNA (in addition to rRNA). We assembled bioinformatics
                    pipelines that produced ~1.2 million CRISPR-gRNAs that were synthesized and used in a one-pot depletion reaction. To my knowledge, I believe this is the first and only 
                    endeavor that has successfully synthesized and used more than a million Cas9-RNPs in any biotechnological context. Additionally, we demonstrated that the entire workflow
                    can be automated in a library preparation instrument seamlessly and reduced turn around times for the workflow.

                    the HaDEA organization (Europe) recognized the importance of this technology and awarded us $24 million to develop a fully automated, cloud-connected
                    instrument that can perform RNA extraction, library preparation, depletion, library synthesis in a fully automated manner. We are developing this instrument for clinical approval
                    in Europe and have received funding from the CDC to initiate clinical approval process in the US.

                  <h4>New-Born Screening (NBS): Enhancing variant-calling accuracies from Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) by removing pseudogene contamination</h4>
                  <p>
                    Pseudogenes are relics of the DNA evolutionary process. They are replicas of functional genes. 
                    Many pseudogenes remain inactive in the genome. Since they are highly similar to their parent genes, 
                    molecules originating from pseudogenes often contaminate sequencing datasets by diluting or exaggerating 
                    variant calls. For instance, a major challenge in diagnosing Lynch syndrome is the presence of the highly 
                    homologous pseudogene PMS2CL. A region covering PMS2 exons 12–15 has very high similarity with PMS2CL, 
                    causing reads to be misaligned and leading to unreliable variant calls in this critical region.

                  <p>
                    At Jumpcode, we developed a CRISPR-based depletion technology that can precisely remove pseudogene-derived molecules in DNA sequencing library preparation workflows. We collaborated with Revvity Omics (previously Perkin Elmer) to develop an assay specifically designed for removing pseudogenes that contaminate variant calls for a few genes tested in new-born screening (NBS) panels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bioinformatics challenge here was two-pronged. First, we had to use heavily constrained paradigms to design CRISPR-gRNAs that target the pseudogene-derived molecules with high specificity. We deployed CRISflash to identify, filter and select gRNA targets. The high degree of similarity between the pseudogenes and parent genes necessitated us to use different flavors of the CAS enzyme - e.g. Cpf1, Cas12a, Cas13, SpCas9. We had to use these CRISPR-RNPs combinatorially in WGS assays that presented additional design problems. Secondly, we deployed clinically used variant calling pipelines to test the efficacy of the process in enhancing variant calling accuracies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As proof of this concept, we targeted the pseudogenes of three important genes in NBS panels - ABCD1, GBA1, and CYP21A2. We demonstrated that ~95% of false positive calls for variants were eliminted. We are further working on developing this technology to broaden its applicability to breast cancer and colon cancer screening panels potentially targeting >4000 pseudogenes.

                    Our work here was instrumental in securing ~$400k in non-dilutive funding from NHGRI (SBIR Phase 1) for technology development.

                  <h4>Cleaning up single cell RNA-seq data using CRISPRclean technology</h4>
                  <p>Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is now increasingly being used for immunology and cancer research. Identifying cell types using transcriptomics signatures specific to a given cell type forms the cornerstone of this technology. The technology requires the sequencing of several thousands cells at high sequencing depth (typically >100 million reads). However, scRNA-seq relies on sequencing reads mapping to only a few hundred (if not a few thousand) genes. Reads that map to the majority of the genes in human transcriptome are simply tossed out because of two main reasons:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Majority of the genes that are highly expressed are ribosomal RNA and house keeping genes that take up >70% of transcriptomics datasets</li>
                    <li>Genes that can accurately characterize cell types are a small subset of the 20k human genes annotated</li>
                  </ul>
                  <img src="assets/images/scrna-seq-1.png" alt="singlecell-1" class="research-section-image"/>
                  <p>Jumpcode Genomics developed its CRISPRclean technology to deplete these highly abundant genes in scRNA-seq workflows. My team and I performed the following tasks to enable this endeavor:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Assembled publicly available scRNA-seq datasets (from SRA and other archives) for various tissue types (blood, PBMCs, liver, brain etc.)</li>
                    <li>Performed meticulous analysis to identify what genes in each tissue types are NOT used by software (Seurat, Cell Ranger) used for cell-type classification</li>
                    <li>Estimate what % of reads do these genes take up in typical scRNA-seq datasets</li>
                    <li>Design CRISPR-gRNAs that selectively target these transcripts while leaving the rest of the transcriptome unperturbed</li>
                    <li>Include specific considerations concerning the scRNA-seq workflow e.g. 10x Genomics' Chromium instrument only uses the 3'-ends of the transcripts while other technologies rely on capturing 5'-end or whole-transcripts.</li>
                    <li>Help our wet-lab team by performing rapid yet rigorous analysis to understand how our CRISPR depletion worked</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We launched the DepleteX Single Cell RNA Boost kit thanks to the contributions listed above. Notably, 10x Genomics and Pacific Biosciences recognized the importance of this product by calling them companion products for their products in the market addressing single cell customers.</p>

                    The versatility offered by DNA sequencing to interrogate the genome is unparalleled. However, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to study targeted sections of genomes presents some challenges. Firstly, the method produces sequencing datasets with a uniform coverage across the genome. This amounts to wastage of sequencing reagents and data when only a fraction of the genome is of interest to your research goals. Secondly, WGS produces lower coverages for larger genomes (compared to the human genome) and those that are polyploids which makes it difficult for genotyping and variant analysis. Therefore, these and several other applications fail to fully exploit the power of WGS. More examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For metagenomics studies, the host DNA often dominates sequencing data and dilutes the microbial content for genome assemblies. When the microbial content is minimal, detection of key microbes becomes a challenging task using a DNA-based sequencing approach. Detection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and assembly of novel pathogens are some of the applications in this regard.</li>
                        <li>In argi-genomics applications (e.g. plant genotyping), researchers would like to study the variants in the functional parts of plant genomes. They resort to low-pass WGS (LP-WGS) or Genotyping-By-Sequencing studies where the coverage is typically <3x across the genome. Plants are polyploids, with larger (and often, incomplete) genomes and less than 5% of their genome is functional. The presence of repetitive elements (typically 45-70% of the genome) overrepresents sequencing datasets diluting the ability to uncover variants in genes. Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) is a viable alternative, but may require the design and synthesis of probes (and the expenses that come with it)</li>
                        <li>The study of gene regulation in animal genomes requires researchers to sequence only the regulatory elements identified by ATAC-Seq or other similar methods. Unfortunately, only 10-20% of the genome is involved in gene regulation. Cell type, environmental stresses and other factors contribute to the variable nature of regulatory elements that makes it harder to design a probe-based capture approach for this application.</li>

                      is a cloud-based customer-facing bioinformatics tool that I developed during my tenure at Thermo Fisher Scientific. This is a one-stop shop for all of Thermo Fisher's gene editing customers
                      to design and visualize their CRISPR experiments. The portal provides an integrated cocktail of algorithms that enables customers to perform <u>gene knockouts</u>, <u>gene tagging</u>, <u>DNA insertions</u>, <u>deletions</u>, <u>point mutations</u>, and other flavors of DNA editing. 
                      The portal allows the customers to design and assemble all associated reagents required for their experiments. Additionally, the tool effortlessly links to Thermo Fisher's ordering portal enabling customers to order their reagents with minimal effort. 
                      The launch of this tool increased Thermo Fisher's revenue for CRISPR-based products by 5-fold within 12 months. I functioned as the lead bioinformatics engineer conducting customer interviews, gathering requirements & painpoints, designing the conceptual user-interface, coding all bioinformatics 
                      tools (e.g. CRISPR design, design of oligos and primers etc.) and establishing connectivity to Thermo Fisher's eCommerce portal. 
                      
                      <li><strong>Rational design of CRISPR-gRNAs to enable gene-editing</strong></li>
                      Machine-learning models started to gain momentum in computational biology around 2015 which was the same time CRISPRs were introduced for genome-editing. 
                      I championed the introduction of regression and feature-learning models to the design of CRISPR-gRNAs by leading an internal project that resulted in significantly 
                      enhancing Thermo Fisher's design algorithms. Using carefully curated experimental data, I built regression models that could accurately predict (1) <u>the outcome of <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR edits</u> (i.e. predicting NHEJ, MMEJ, or HR), (2) <u>potential off-target effects</u>, 
                      (3) <u>efficiency of CRISPRs</u>. These models were directly used in customer-facing and internal tools to design and select better CRISPR-gRNA oligos. Features such as sequence motifs in gRNA target sites, chromatin accessibility, PAM site preferences, density of CRISPR target sites in the neighborhood and others 
                      were carefully curated to boost the performance of the models. 

                      <li><strong>Ready-made CRISPR databases for the construction of genome-wide knockout screening libraries (Lentiviral and RNA-based delivery methods) </strong></li>
                      Feng Zhang lab created the <a href="https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/zhang-human-gecko-v2/">GeCKO</a> library for performing genome-wide knockout screens. These libraries can be used to study cell viability, cancer proliferation, immunological relevance of genes, and in general to understand the functional processes in the genome. 
                      Thermo Fisher developed a library of CRISPR-gRNAs that could be delivered in cells by using thousands of inactivated lentiviral particles. These delivery vehicles can transport CRISPR-gRNAs and CRISPR proteins effortlessly into the cell's nucleus and integrate them in the chromosome. 
                      CRISPR systems integrated in the genome can then be activated to perform precise edits in cells to knockout, practically, any gene of interest. To facilitate this, I built a fully annotated database of CRISPR-gRNA molecules leveraging data from machine learning models that could be readily purchased for knocking out a large subset of human and mouse genes. 
                      The database connected seamlessly to Thermo Fisher's eCommerce and IT portals that facilitated rapid conversion of queries to orders. Additionally, I build LIMS software systems that connected liquid handlers (Tecan, BioMek etc.) to automate the cell engineering workflow end-to-end. The process involved the design of CRISPR-gRNAs, transfection or delivery of 
                      particles inside the cells in bulk, incubation & growth, picking of clonal populations in an iterative process and finally, confirmation assays to validate edited cells.

                  <h4>Research Synopsis</h4>
                  <p>I was a graduate researcher in Prof. Costas D Maranas lab. Our research goals were to develop computational models of bacterial metabolism from genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets. Subsequently, we developed algorithms that can use these models to predict what genes can be manipulated to make them overproduce certain value-added biochemicals of interest.
                    Several biotech companies rely on these models and algorithms. For example, <a href="https://www.genomatica.com/">Geno</a> uses these models to engineer recombinant strains of bacteria to synthesize 1,4-butanediol (BDO).

                    OptForce is a computational optimization framework for metabolic engineering that systematically identifies all possible genetic interventions required to achieve targeted overproduction of biochemicals in microorganisms. Unlike traditional approaches, OptForce leverages flux measurements a nd mathematically contrasts wild-type and overproducing strains to pinpoint which metabolic reaction fluxes need to be increased, decreased, or eliminated. The method groups these reactions hierarchically and then extracts a minimal, actionable set of genetic modifications—the FORCE set—that ensures the metabolic network supports the desired product yield. Successfully applied to succinate production in E. coli, OptForce reveals both intuitive and unforeseen engineering strategies, including coordinated changes distant from the core product pathway, guiding experimental design for strain optimization.
